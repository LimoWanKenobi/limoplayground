#Conferences Video Lists

Every conference is now publishing the videos of their talks. Some of them are
publishing the videos in Youtube, some others in Vimeo, I suppose there are
others in other services too.

The first idea is to have a list of conferences. For each conference, some
information about it, and the list of videos that belongs to that conference.

The second idea is to save on client-side storage, the videos already watched
and a list of videos "Loved" or "liked" or something similar. Videos in the
watched list will be hidden or faded out. This functionality exists on Youtube
but not on Vimeo I believe.

We can build something else from there.
